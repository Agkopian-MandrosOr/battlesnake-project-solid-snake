# Name of Project :

SOLID SNAKE

# Description :

This project aims to create a competitve battlesnake, that uses complex and smart algorithms, in order to stay ahead of the competition. This project was completed in accordance to the coursework of the Software Development in Practise module( Spring Semester 2023), of the University of York, European Campus, City College, Thessaloniki, Greece.

# Technologies :

All the coding has been done with the Javascript programming language. However in the project you will find many files that are written in HTML and CSS that were automatically generated.

# Prerequisites :

Most important installation is that of node.js, which is needed for the installation of all other dependancies.

For linting, dependancies need no be installed for eslint, prettier and config.

For testing and test coverage, jest and babel are needed.
# Folder Structure :

All the functions are external and located in a separate javascript folder. 

Test files similary are inside their own test folder.

# How to Run :

### Developer Mode

Here are the steps that you need to follow in order to run the project in developer mode:

1. **Installation**: Download the latest version of node.js

2. **Dependencies**: Go to your prefered editor terminal and type this: npm install

3. **Starting the Development Server**: To start the development server, run the following command:

npm run dev

4. **Accessing the Application**: Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8000]to access the application.

### Testing Mode

Use the command npx jest and all test are going to be run automatically.

### Production Mode

In order to run the SOLIDSNAKE in production mode,
Create an account in Replit,
on the menu on the left press "Create Repl"
search for the Blank Repl and create it
inside there you will upload the folder with the SOLIDSNAKE code
next you need to run the server in Replit,
head over to https://play.battlesnake.com/
create an account if you do not have one already,
from the menu on the left, go to create game,
select the option "Public Battlesnakes",
search for "SDP_Solid Snake",
press add to game and then start the game,
You should see the moves running on the console log in Replit.

# How to run tests :

In order to run tests you need to head over to the replit repository and press Ctrl + Enter or Run the server from the green button located in the middle top of the page. Then head over to Battlesnake and run the SOLIDSNAKE. After you have done that, if you go back to the Replit page, you will see the console log showing the coordinates of the head of the snake, the foods that are available on the map as well as other critical information that you need to know.

# How to deploy on production :
To deploy on production, if you followed the steps on how to run tests, all you have to do now is to go back to the Battlesnake page where we left off and hit the play button, you will see the snake starting to hunt for the food on the map.

# Variables :
myHead, myNeck, boardWidth, boardHeight, isMoveSafe, isMovePref,  opponents, safeMoves, food.

# Extended documentation :
We currently have only the base documentation available.

# Mockups :
There are no mockups available in our project
